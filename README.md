# JOS

JOS is a excellent operating system provided by [MIT 6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2014/overview.html). It gives you the skeleton code but left vacancies in details, so you can learn the important concepts of OS by building one without the burden of annoying hardware details. The major works you need to finish are divided into six labs:

1. Booting
2. Memory management
3. User environments
4. Preemptive multitasking
5. File system, spawn, and shell
6. Network driver

To build JOS, You don't need to read the code of xv6, learn the lectures, or do any kind of pre-work. **Just read everything in `Labs` and do anything it asks!** The labs are neither so easy nor so hard to finish if you:

- Read the materials and the comments carefully.
- Think everything carefully before doing anything.
- Be patient when debugging :P
